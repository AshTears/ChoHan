/**
 * ChoHan is a traditional Japanese gambling game using dice. The game uses two 
 * standard six-sided dice, which are shaken in a bamboo cup or bowl by a dealer. 
 * The cup is then overturned onto the floor. Players then place their wagers 
 * on whether the sum total of numbers showing on the two dice will 
 * be "Ch≈ç" (even) or "Han" (odd). The dealer then removes the cup, displaying the dice. 
 * The winners collect their money.
